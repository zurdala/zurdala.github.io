# About me

This is basically answering the question "Who am I"?

Well, I am very bad at these things. My therapist knows that.

So I am crossing the 30s line soon. I am also Spanish, from Madrid. Since two years, I live in Germany.

I think I have always been a bit of a nerd. I love sci-fi and I used to read a lot of fantasy.
Lately I also enjoy a lot modern fiction in terms of books.

My sci-fi love probably took me to study space engineering, which is what feeds me nowadays, but more focused on algorithms and astrodynamics than anything else at the moment. More software and computation than building or designing spacecraft. Mostly focused on the problem of [space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) and [space sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_sustainability).

Curious is an adjective that I usually put to myself. From history to linguistics and etymology, also a lot with computers and technology.
I remember when I first installed Linux in my laptop 15 years ago. If I am not mistaken, it was Ubuntu 11.04, the first one with the Unity desktop (see, very nerdy).

This is probably the reason I resonate so much with the open source movement, and their counterparts in science and data.
The last part made want to deep a bit my toes into the topic of Studies of Science and Technology.

Some work friends frequenly joke that I am a bit like John Malkovich [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDLvUqhwHZc). And a lot of my friends consider me a mix of an old soul and a grumpy old man.

I tend to look for slow moments to read while I travel or I am in nature, alone or with my partner. In general, I enjoy to explore and wander around when I have the energy.

So this is another slow corner that I got for myself. This time on the Internet.
