# Â¡Welcome!

Hi, my name is Dani, and I am a space engineer with a big interest in the open movement: science, data, source...

During the day, I work as product manager and a software developer at a small space company focused in space traffic coordination. During the night, I [read](./books) and play around with my Linux computer.

Although originally from Spain, I am now based in a city close to Hannover, Germany.
