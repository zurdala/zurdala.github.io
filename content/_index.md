Hi, my name is Daniel, and I am a space engineer with a big interest in the open movement: science, data, source...

During the day, I work as product manager and a software developer at a small space company focused in space traffic coordination. During the night, I [read](./books) and play around with my computer: this blog, trying new programming languages, refreshing some space concepts or watching some TV show from my local Plex.

Although originally from Madrid, Spain, I am now based in Darmstadt, Germany, the *Science City*.
