# Â¡Welcome!

Hi, my name is Dani, and I am a space engineer with a big interest in the open movement: culture, science, data, source... 
I like transparency and being able to access the work of others. 
This is important for so many reasons: learning, trustability, privacy... But in the end, it all goes back to sharing and cooperation.

During the day, I work as product manager and a software developer at a small space company focused in space traffic coordination. During the night, I [read](./books) and play around with my Ubuntu computer.

Although originally from Spain, I am now based in a city close to Hannover, Germany.

Feel free to check what I am [lately focused on](./now) and what tools I normally [use](./uses).
