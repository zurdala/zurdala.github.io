# Now

_Last updated: January 2025_

I like [this trend](https://nownownow.com/about) and it is one of the reasons I decided to start this site.

I am currently trying to get myself less dependant of centralized services. For example, I am moving my digital accounts to my personal email using my own domain, away from Gmail.
Same with contacts and calendars. I am using Fastmail and it is fantastic.

At the same time, I am trying to figure out what to do with my pictures (currently backed in Google Photos) and music. I am a user of Spotify, but I still keep lots of GBs of old files.

Another thing taking some of my time is creating this site. It is still quite barebones and I want to fill it and make it prettier (while keeping it simple).

I am also trying to be more present in the real world: less social media based on algorithms, more walks around, more handcrafted hobbies... My partner and I like to explore the surroundings of Braunschweig, where we still reside.

And finally, I want to read more. I own a large collection of books, most of them still unread. I want to change that.

That's it for now!
