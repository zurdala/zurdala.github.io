# Projects in the open

## NEPTUNE contributor

As part of my current job, I'm a frequent contributor and maintainer of the NEPTUNE [orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_state_vectors) propagator.

> NPI Ephemeris Propagation Tool with Uncertainty Extrapolation is a state of the art numerical orbit propagator. It allows the extrapolation of a state vector and the associated uncertainty forward and backward in time.

## SWAMI Atmosphere model (2021)

SWAMI was a H2020 project that developed the MOWA Climatological Model (MCM) by integrating the Unified Model (UM) from the UK's MetOffice, covering the atmosphere up to 120 km, with the Drag Temperature Model (DTM2020) from France's CNES, which extends from 120 to 1500 km. MCM provides detailed estimates of temperature, density, and wind, using solar radio flux (F10.7) and geomagnetic index (Kp) as drivers, while the UM is optimized through averaged data tables for efficiency. The DTM2020 is available in both operational and more precise research versions, with different drivers for each.

## NANOSTAR documentation (2017)

During my university studies, I was involved in the NANOSTAR project.
As part of it, I lead and prepared the deployment of the documentation for the students that would participate in the NANOSTAR challenge.
