## NEPTUNE contributor

As part of my current job, I'm a frequent contributor and maintainer of the NEPTUNE [orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_state_vectors) propagator.

> NPI Ephemeris Propagation Tool with Uncertainty Extrapolation is a state of the art numerical orbit propagator. It allows the extrapolation of a state vector and the associated uncertainty forward and backward in time.

During my university studies, I was involved in the NANOSTAR project.
As part of it, I lead and prepared the deployment of the documentation for the students that would participate in the NANOSTAR challenge.
