So today I publish the first entry on this site.
It is still very barebones and I will try to keep it updated whenever I feel like I should.
I do not promise anything, fellow non-reader.

I have already added `/now` and `/uses` pages, as well as a very quick overview of the projects I have participated in that have results in the open during my studies and my professional life.
Hopefully I can add there soon stuff done during my free time that is worth a shout.

So yeah, this is it. This is a start.
Read you around!
