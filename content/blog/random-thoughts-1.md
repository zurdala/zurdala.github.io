It's been a while since I wrote something here.

I have been busy forgetting I had a blog and since I took a sick day, I have decided to write something. I am letting my mind come with random thoughts here, 
random words, random sentences, random paragraphs.
While writing this, I got bothered that the `micro` editor does not have automatic line wrap. I wanted to write this post using the terminal.

Anyway, maybe I can write a bit of what I have been looking into lately.

I have decided that I want to get more involved in the open source movement, and since Python has given me so much, I want to use it somehow.
These days, in moments of random boredom, I was looking for projects, not quite finding what to do. I want to contribute to something that excites me,
since volunteering needs a lot of inner drive to keep doing it.

And I think last night I found it. I love reading, and I love managing my book collection. Currently, I use Goodreads to follow this, since it has the biggest
catalogue and my friends are there. But there are alternatives, and one of those is [BookWyrm](http://joinbookwyrm.com/), a book tracker using the [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks) protocol written in Python.

So that's it.

This post is also here to make me accountable, to myself and to my dear non-existent readers apart from my partner and I.

Maybe this blog should have this purpose. Document my process in fully getting into open source and the open movement.

Now, I need to find a [_good first issue_](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22).
