While navigating Mastodon, I came up with [this post](https://bsky.app/profile/mleduc.xyz/post/3lgbu5kn5rc2j) from Manuel Leduc (bridged from BlueSky).

It was linking to [a post](https://mleduc.xyz/fosdem-2025-sustainability/) he made with the most relevant talks at FOSDEM in the topic of Sustainability (a word whose meaning is being more stretched and streched thanks to greenwashing).
In any case, I would the compilation quite insightful and it picked my interest to maybe attend the next FOSDEM if it happens during a good time for me. Definitely go check it out.

But I am here to talk about carbon rating for websites.
I noticed that the author had a little badge rating their websites carbon impact. It is provided by websitecarbon.com

From the description, the way it works is by computing the resources required to transfer and load your page and estimate the equivalent electricity consumption. This is then matched to the carbon emissions, as it also considers the source of the energy. There is more information [here](https://www.websitecarbon.com/how-does-it-work/).

I am happy to report that this site gets an A+, which makes sense since the theme is very minimal and it is a static website.

Anyway, I wanted to share this as a note also for myself but in case it is useful for others.

Down there in the future you can find a link to this site's rating. I am still debating adding the badge in itself.
