Zettelkasten is a note-taking method to generate ideas down the line.

When taking a note about something, you can add tags and references to other notes.

They always need to contain a reference and should always be self-contained. Not just a reference to something else.

These are principles:

- Atomic: just one single idea
- Autonomous: self-contained
- Always linked
- Link needs to be explained
- Idea must be expressed in own words
- Keep references to originals
- Add own thoughts
- No worrying about structure
- Add connection notes
- Add outline notes, for themes
- Never delete
- Add notes without worrying
